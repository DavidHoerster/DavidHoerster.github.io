      <description>This post is the first in an occasional series on building a distributed system using Akka.NET. Check back as I add to this series.&#xA;I was reminded of how much the Actor Model influenced me as a developer when I recently read Petabridge&amp;rsquo;s post about reflecting on 10 years of building Akka.NET. At first I thought, &amp;ldquo;oh my goodness - it&amp;rsquo;s been 10 years!!&amp;rdquo; and reflected on how much my life has changed over those 10 years.</description>
